##  :child: :card_index: **robofight_tree_manage** :child: :card_index:
One of my project for Data Structure 2nd Semester. The project is a simple CRUD cardgame (fictional) using implementation of tree.
The project is actually related with [sorting_searching_cardgame](https://github.com/Louis3112/sorting_searching_cardgame).

Robofight Card (fictional) has 3 information : Card code, Power, HP.

However, on this project, we only use the card code.
![data_card](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c02fb3b-5c1a-471c-868a-963e1305548e) 
(which user have to input the code manually)

User can sort the card by using 6 ways 
1. Enter the card code
2. See all card code (with traversal choice, e.g., in-order, pre-order, post-order)
3. Delete a card code
4. Find a card code
5. Count total cards
6. Checking first and last card codes

The project is developed using Functional programming, C++ language, runs on CLI, and only requires iostream

There is a [report](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18420976/085_TI2023C_Tugas.Tree.docx)
